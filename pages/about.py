    Hello! 👋 I'm *Yashika*, a dedicated **Tax Accountant** with a passion for clarity in Canadian finance.

    ### *My Journey in Tax and Finance*

    My professional life in accounting and finance began right here in Brampton, graduating from *Humber College North Campus* with a focus on these fields. My deep dive into the world of *Canadian taxation* started about three years ago, leading to my very first internship while still in college.

    For the past *two years*, I've worked as a Tax Accountant, refining my skills across various firms. I've also built a successful freelance practice, supporting numerous clients with personal **tax returns and adjustments**. I take immense pride in my high success rate and my proven ability to **fix returns** that were initially filed incorrectly, helping clients navigate stressful correspondence from the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency).
